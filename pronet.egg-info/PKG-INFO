 pronet

`pronet` is a Python library for fetching protein interactions from STRING database, 
building protein networks, visualizing them, and generating reports.

1- Installation

```bash
pip install pronet

2-  Usage

Here is a simple example of how to use pronet: 
from pronet import get_string_interactions, build_network, generate_report

proteins = ["BRCA1", "MDM2", "EGFR"]
data = get_string_interactions(proteins)
G = build_network(data, proteins, show_plot=True, layout="circular")
generate_report(G, proteins, data, save_path="protein_report.txt")

3-  Requirements

Python >= 3.8

requests

networkx

matplotlib
 
4- Features

Fetch interactions for a list of proteins using STRING API.

Build and visualize protein interaction networks using NetworkX and Matplotlib.

Generate detailed reports including main proteins, top interactions, and network statistics.

Choose different network layouts: spring, circular, or shell.
